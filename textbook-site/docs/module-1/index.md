# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. In this module, we'll explore the foundation of robotic systems: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). Just as the nervous system coordinates actions in biological organisms, ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that enables different components of a robot to work together harmoniously.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes for different robot components
- Implement communication between nodes using topics and services
- Integrate Python with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Describe robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Apply ROS 2 best practices for educational and professional robotics projects

## Module Overview

ROS 2 is the backbone of modern robotic systems. It provides the infrastructure for:
- Process communication via topics, services, and actions
- Distributed computing across multiple machines
- Package management for reusable robot software
- Tools for debugging, visualization, and simulation

This module will guide you through the essential ROS 2 concepts with practical examples relevant to humanoid robotics.

## Prerequisites for this Module

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with fundamental robotics concepts

## Hardware and Software Requirements

For this module, you'll need:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Basic Python development environment

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several sections:

1. [ROS 2 Introduction](./ros2-introduction.md) - Overview of ROS 2 and its architecture
2. [ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services](./ros2-nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication patterns
3. [Python Integration with rclpy](./rclpy-python-integration.md) - Connecting Python to ROS 2
4. [URDF Robot Description](./urdf-robot-description.md) - Representing robots in ROS 2
5. [ROS 2 Best Practices](./ros2-best-practices.md) - Guidelines for effective development
6. [Module 1 Exercises](./exercises.md) - Hands-on practice with the concepts

## Getting Started

Let's begin by exploring the fundamentals of ROS 2 and understanding why it's essential for modern robotics development. Proceed to the [next section](./ros2-introduction.md) to dive into ROS 2 basics.
