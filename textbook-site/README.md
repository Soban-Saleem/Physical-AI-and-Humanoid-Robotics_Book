# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. This textbook aims to teach full-system integration skills combining ROS 2, simulation environments, and applied AI for embodied systems.

## About

This textbook is designed for graduate students, professional engineers, and advanced hobbyists transitioning to robotics. It covers:

- ROS 2 (The Robotic Nervous System)
- Simulation environments (The Digital Twin)
- Applied AI for embodied systems (The AI-Robot Brain)
- Vision-Language-Action models (VLA)

## Current Status

We're currently building the textbook modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- [x] ROS 2 Introduction
- [x] ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- [x] Python Integration with rclpy
- [x] URDF Robot Description
- [x] ROS 2 Best Practices
- [x] Module 1 Exercises

More modules are under development.

## Structure

The textbook is organized into four core modules followed by a capstone project:

1. Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
3. Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
4. Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
5. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Project
