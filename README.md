# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This project implements a comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus, with integrated features including a RAG chatbot, authentication, personalization, and Urdu translation capabilities.

## Project Status

Currently implementing Phase 1: Setup and Project Initialization from the [tasks.md](specs/1-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md) plan.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] T001: Set up Docusaurus project structure for textbook
- [x] T002: Configure Docusaurus theme and styling per requirements
- [x] T003: Set up GitHub Pages deployment configuration
- [x] T004: Create project directory structure for modules and content
- [x] T005-T010: Created initial documentation structure including:
  - Introduction to the textbook
  - Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
    - ROS 2 Introduction
    - ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
    - Python Integration with rclpy
    - URDF Robot Description
    - ROS 2 Best Practices
    - Module 1 Exercises

### In Progress
- Continuing with Phase 1 tasks
- Beginning Phase 2: Foundational Components

### Next Steps
- Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks
- Proceed to Phase 2: Foundational Components
- Implement Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Implement Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- Implement Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Implement Capstone Project

## Implementation Approach

Following the specification and plan outlined in:
- [spec.md](specs/1-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md)
- [plan.md](specs/1-physical-ai-textbook/plan.md)
- [tasks.md](specs/1-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md)

## Architecture

The textbook is structured as a comprehensive Docusaurus site with:
1. Interactive content modules covering ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI for embodied systems
2. Hands-on projects building to a capstone autonomous humanoid project
3. Code examples verified on specified hardware configurations
4. Integration of multiple technology stacks (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, etc.)

## Technology Stack

- **Documentation Platform**: Docusaurus
- **Primary Technologies**: ROS 2 Humble, Ubuntu 22.04, Gazebo Garden, NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **Hardware Focus**: Unitree Go2/Go2 Edu, NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
- **Target Audience**: Graduate students, professional engineers, advanced hobbyists

## Contributing

This project follows the Spec-Driven Development methodology with clear specifications, plans, and tasks. All contributions should align with the project's architectural decisions and requirements.
